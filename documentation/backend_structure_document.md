```sql
-- Users Table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  full_name VARCHAR(255),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Tasks Table
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  priority VARCHAR(50),
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending',
  due_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Calendars Table
CREATE TABLE calendars (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  google_calendar_id VARCHAR(255),
  settings JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Schedules Table
CREATE TABLE schedules (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  ai_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  schedule_data JSONB, -- stores the calendar plan details
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- RecurringTasks Table
CREATE TABLE recurring_tasks (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  task_id INTEGER REFERENCES tasks(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  recurrence_pattern VARCHAR(100), -- e.g., daily, weekly, custom
  auto_reschedule BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Notifications Table
CREATE TABLE notifications (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  type VARCHAR(50), -- email, in-app, push
  message TEXT,
  is_read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Subscriptions Table
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  stripe_subscription_id VARCHAR(255),
  status VARCHAR(50),
  current_period_end TIMESTAMPTZ,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
