# Implementation Plan: TaskMind AI

This document outlines a step-by-step, security- and privacy-focused implementation plan for TaskMind AI: a platform converting natural language goals into actionable calendar plans. The plan emphasizes secure coding principles, robust authentication, data encryption, and privacy compliance using our chosen technologies.

---

## 1. Project Setup & Onboarding

- **Repository & Version Control**
  - Initiate a Git repository with branch protections.
  - Use a lockfile (e.g., package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to manage dependency versions.
  - Integrate a CI/CD pipeline with automated security scans (SCA) for dependency vulnerabilities.

- **Environment Configuration & Secrets Management**
  - Store configuration variables securely using environment variables and a secrets manager (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault).
  - Follow secure defaults; ensure debug mode is disabled in production.

- **Dependency Management**
  - Vet all third-party libraries (Next.js 14, Tailwind, Clerk, etc.) and maintain updated versions.
  - Regularly run automated vulnerability scanning tools as part of the CI/CD process.

## 2. Frontend Development

- **Technology Setup**
  - Use Next.js 14 (App Router) with TypeScript for type safety.
  - Integrate Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and Framer Motion for a clean, responsive design.
  - Utilize TanStack Query for efficient client-side data management.

- **User Interface & Experience**
  - Design modular, responsive components and a minimalistic dashboard layout.
  - Implement smooth animations and transitions with Framer Motion.
  - Ensure accessibility, i18n, and localization best practices.

- **Security Measures**
  - Implement context-aware output encoding and CSP headers to prevent XSS.
  - Secure cookies by using HttpOnly, Secure, and SameSite attributes.
  - Validate all input on client side (with mirrored server-side validation).

---

## 3. Backend & API Development

- **Architecture Setup**
  - Use Supabase with PostgreSQL 15, implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) for granular data access control.
  - Set up Prisma ORM for secure, parameterized interactions with the PostgreSQL database.
  - Implement tRPC for type-safe API communication, ensuring strict input validation.

- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Integrate Clerk for robust user authentication (OAuth, social login, MFA, session management).
  - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) for all endpoints, ensuring solo users have full access while planning optional collaboration features.
  - Use JWT with secure algorithms, expiration, and refresh token mechanisms. Validate tokens server-side on every protected endpoint.

- **Data Encryption & Privacy**
  - Encrypt sensitive data both at-rest (using AES-256) and in-transit (TLS 1.2+).
  - Implement field-level encryption where PII is stored.
  - Maintain activity logs and ensure compliance with GDPR/CCPA for privacy requirements.

- **API & Service Security**
  - Enforce HTTPS for all API requests.
  - Implement rate-limiting and throttling, e.g., using Redis (Upstash) for in-memory rate tracking.
  - Validate and sanitize all input from the front end.
  - Minimize data exposure by returning only necessary data in responses.
  - Secure external API integrations (Google Calendar, OpenAI GPT-4) by using least privilege scopes and secure keys.

## 4. Core Features Implementation

### A. AI Scheduling

- **Input Handling & Processing**
  - Accept natural language input and rigorously sanitize it to prevent injection attacks.
  - Integrate OpenAI GPT-4 with clear rate-limiting; ensure API keys remain secure.

- **Flexible Scheduling**
  - Enable drag-and-drop functionalities and dynamic reordering.
  - Maintain an audit trail for changes with revision history and undo/redo features.

- **Error Handling & Feedback**
  - Provide clear error messages and recovery options, ensuring error pages do not leak sensitive details.
  - Implement a feedback loop from users to refine AI-generated plans.

### B. Calendar Synchronization & Interactive Calendar

- **Google Calendar Sync**
  - Use Google API with minimal scopes required to perform two-way sync.
  - Validate redirect URLs and use allow-lists to prevent open redirects and misconfigurations.

- **Interactive Calendar Features**
  - Implement drag-and-drop interactions with visual feedback.
  - Support advanced recurrence patterns through robust scheduling logic.
  - Ensure real-time updates via Supabase real-time features.

### C. Notifications

- **Notification System**
  - Implement multi-channel notifications: email, in-app, and optional push notifications.
  - Ensure secure email workflows and store notification data with appropriate encryption.

### D. Analytics Dashboard

- **Data Collection & Visualization**
  - Collect and display metrics like task completion rates and time allocations using charts (pie charts, bar graphs, trend lines).
  - Ensure that data exported (CSV/PDF) is sanitized and secure.

### E. Collaboration (Optional)

- **Shared Calendar & Suggested Edits**
  - Limit collaboration to view-only or suggested edits via a secure approval process.
  - Display presence indicators while protecting user identity and roles.

### F. AI Usage Limits & Subscriptions

- **Subscription Integration**
  - Integrate Stripe for managing subscriptions and payments with well-defined premium tiers.
  - Use middleware checks for enforcing feature access based on user roles and subscription status.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Use Redis (Upstash) for tracking API usage and imposing limits on AI usage to avoid abuse.

## 5. Infrastructure & Deployment

- **Server Configuration & Hardening**
  - Secure server environments: disable unused ports, configure firewalls, and enforce least privilege on all accounts.
  - Utilize TLS 1.2+ and disable outdated protocols.
  - Ensure regular encrypted backups and enable point-in-time recovery.

- **Monitoring & Logging**
  - Implement detailed activity logs while masking sensitive information.
  - Utilize monitoring tools to detect anomalies and potential breaches.

- **CI/CD & DevOps**
  - Secure the full pipeline by integrating static code analysis, automated testing (including security tests), and dependency scanning.
  - Ensure deployment scripts do not expose sensitive data by using secure credential management.

---

## 6. Final Testing & Auditing

- **Penetration Testing & Code Review**
  - Perform manual and automated tests on authentication, RLS, and API endpoints.
  - Engage third-party security audits if necessary.

- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**
  - Validate that all planned features meet functional and security requirements.
  - Conduct end-to-end testing for calendar sync, notifications, and subscription flows.

- **Documentation & Privacy Policy**
  - Document security design principles, encryption protocols, and access controls.
  - Publish clear and transparent privacy policies and consent management practices.

## 7. Maintenance & Future Enhancements

- **Regular Updates**
  - Monitor dependency vulnerabilities and apply timely patches.
  - Update configuration for new security recommendations and compliance requirements.

- **Feedback Loop & Iteration**
  - Implement processes for continuous improvement based on user feedback and system monitoring.
  - Update logs, analytics, and audit records to maintain secure practices over time.
