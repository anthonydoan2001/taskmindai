# TaskMind AI App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Upon arriving at TaskMind AI, a new user is welcomed by a clean landing page with a minimalistic design that showcases the main value proposition of turning natural language goals into personalized calendar plans. The landing page provides clear directions to either sign up or sign in using secure authentication powered by Clerk. New users can create an account by selecting from multiple sign-up methods including email and social login options. The sign-up process guides the user through inputting basic information, confirming their identity via multi-factor authentication, and agreeing to terms and privacy policies before proceeding. Users encountering existing accounts are provided with a straightforward sign-in view where they input their credentials. In cases where a user forgets their password, a dedicated recovery link is available to initiate a password reset flow, ensuring that users can regain access efficiently. Once authenticated, the onboarding experience introduces the major features of the platform through helpful tooltips and contextual hints, establishing familiarity with entering natural language goals, Google Calendar synchronization, and the interactive scheduling interface.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After successfully signing in, the user is automatically directed to the main dashboard which serves as the central command center of TaskMind AI. This dashboard is designed with a clean and uncluttered layout featuring a prominent natural language input area at its center, where the user can quickly type in goals or tasks in everyday language. Surrounding the input area is a visually engaging calendar that reflects the AI-generated schedule, enhanced with drag-and-drop capabilities for manual adjustments. The top of the dashboard includes a header with easily accessible navigation options and a user profile section, while a side panel or modular widget area provides an at-a-glance look at productivity analytics and performance insights such as charts and timelines. Clear navigation cues direct users to additional sections such as task details, calendar management, and notifications, ensuring that each journey from the dashboard is intuitive and directly connected to the user’s goals.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

Once on the dashboard, the user is encouraged to start by entering a natural language goal like "Prepare presentation for Monday meeting." Immediately, the system leverages GPT-4 to analyze the input and convert it into a draft schedule which appears on the calendar. The user sees real-time visual updates as events and tasks populate the calendar view. If a user wishes to make adjustments, they can seamlessly drag and drop events within the calendar interface to customize timings, lock specific time blocks, or reorder tasks by priority. The platform supports rich recurring task options with the ability to establish daily, weekly, monthly, or custom patterns, allowing recurring events to be set as per the user’s routine needs. When a recurring event is modified, users see a smooth transition to a detailed settings view where they can define intervals, number of repetitions, and exceptions to the repetition policy. In parallel, when users have multiple calendars synchronized through Google Calendar, two-way synchronization ensures that any change made in TaskMind AI is immediately reflected in the external calendar, preserving consistency across platforms. The analytics dashboard provides an additional flow where users can review productivity metrics, see visual graphs for task completion rates and time allocation, and export data in CSV or PDF format if needed. Additionally, features such as reminders and notifications are integrated into the experience, triggering in-app alerts, email updates, or even push notifications (if activated) to notify the user about upcoming tasks or schedule changes. If the user is on the free plan with rate-limited AI access, clear messaging is presented to outline the current usage and upgrade options, guiding the user in real-time through the upgrade path using Stripe-powered in-app billing management.

## Settings and Account Management

Users can access the settings page from the main dashboard via a clearly labeled option in the header or side menu. In this section, personal information is securely managed allowing changes to email addresses, passwords, or multi-factor authentication settings through Clerk’s robust authentication system. The settings page also offers a space to adjust app-specific preferences such as notification channels, theme mode (light or dark), and calendar synchronization details. For billing and subscription management, users can review their current subscription tier, see usage statistics related to AI scheduling requests, and make modifications or upgrades through an integrated Stripe checkout process. This section provides users with straightforward options to revoke third-party access, such as disconnecting Google Calendar if needed, and also offers audit logs to review recent account activity. Once the desired adjustments are made, returning to the main application is seamless through an easily accessible navigation option which brings the user back to their personalized dashboard without interrupting the overall flow.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

Throughout the user journey, TaskMind AI is designed to provide clear, concise information when errors occur. For instance, if the user enters invalid input on the natural language interface or if the AI fails to process an input due to technical issues, a friendly error message appears near the input field with suggestions to try again or rephrase the request. In scenarios of connectivity loss, the system displays a temporary fallback message advising the user to check their internet connection while preserving their current data inputs. If the user attempts to access a restricted area, such as premium features without the correct subscription, the application promptly informs them and provides a clear upgrade path. Similarly, when authentication issues arise, such as expired sessions or problems with credential verification, the system redirects the user to a re-login page ensuring that recovery steps are straightforward. In all error states, visual feedback such as soft animations and clear text instructions help maintain a smooth recovery process, ensuring that users remain confident in re-establishing their normal flow.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

TaskMind AI guides users from the very first interaction on the landing page through to complex schedule creation, modifications, and analytics without overwhelming them. The journey begins with a secure and informative onboarding process, smoothly transitions into an intuitive main dashboard that allows users to translate natural language inputs into structured plans, and provides robust options for manual adjustments using a clear drag-and-drop interface. Settings and account management are designed to empower users to customize their experience, control notifications, and manage subscriptions seamlessly. Even when errors occur or alternate pathways are needed, the application provides clear directives and recovery options that ensure the user remains in control. Overall, TaskMind AI serves as a comprehensive scheduling assistant, blending automation with user control to help busy professionals, entrepreneurs, and productivity-minded individuals achieve their daily goals efficiently.
