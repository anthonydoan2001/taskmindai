# TaskMind AI - Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

TaskMind AI is a web-based application designed to assist professionals, entrepreneurs, and productivity-focused individuals in transforming their natural language objectives into structured calendar plans. By converting plain language inputs (such as "prepare presentation for Monday meeting") into actionable schedules, TaskMind AI aims to simplify daily planning, improve time management, and deliver actionable insights that guide users towards achieving their priorities.

The motivation behind building TaskMind AI is to empower users like freelancers, small business owners, and students with a streamlined tool that integrates seamlessly with existing calendars. The primary objectives are to provide a secure and flexible platform that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) via GPT-4 for intelligent scheduling, and to ensure tight integration with tools like Google Calendar for real-time synchronization. Success will be determined by user satisfaction, reflected in ease of use, enhanced productivity, and improved task completion rates.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

- **Secure Authentication:** Utilizing Clerk for logins, social integrations, and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- **AI Scheduled Planning:** Using GPT-4 to translate natural language into draft schedules.
- **Calendar Synchronization:** Real-time, two-way syncing with Google Calendar.
- **Interactive Calendar:** Featuring a drag-and-drop interface for task customization and recurring task management.
- **Analytics Dashboard:** Providing insights on productivity metrics such as task completion rates and time allocation.
- **Export Options:** Allowing output of schedules in CSV and PDF forms.
- **Multi-Channel Notifications:** Set up notifications via email and in-app messages with optional push notifications.
- **AI Behavior Customization:** Options for setting AI scheduling preferences like time of day, buffer times, and more.
- **Task Categorization & Tagging:** Categorizing tasks, filtering views by category, and adding visual tags or color codes.
- **AI Feedback Loop:** Allows AI to learn user habits and preferences for more tailored schedules.
- **Rate Limiting:** Managing free users' AI usage with a clear path to paid plans via Stripe.

**Out-of-Scope:**

- Advanced real-time collaboration tools beyond simple sharing and suggestions.
- Integration with non-Google calendar systems in the initial phase.
- Offline access or complex UI customizations beyond standard themes.
- Storage of AI prompts or responses for longer than necessary, balancing ethical data usage.

## 3. User Flow

A new user journeys through TaskMind AI beginning by signing up or logging in via Clerk, either through email/password or social OAuth options. The onboarding process is straightforward, introducing users to core functionalities like the natural language task input and calendar sync setup with Google Calendar, establishing a secure and intuitive user experience.

Upon successful login, the user is directed to their personalized dashboard, which features a simple input field for natural language goal entries. Using GPT-4, these are transformed into draft schedules visible on an adaptable calendar where users can manually adjust entries. The interface supports a drag-and-drop mechanism and allows for color-coded task organization. Users can delve into productivity insights through a series of charts and graphs on their dashboard, and customize scheduling preferences via the settings menu.

## 4. Core Features (Bullet Points)

- **User Authentication:** Secure via Clerk with options for social logins and MFA.
- **AI Scheduling:** Natural language processing by GPT-4 to automate scheduling tasks.
- **Calendar Sync:** Seamless two-way connection with Google Calendar for real-time updates.
- **Interactive Interface:** Allows drag-and-drop for tasks, with recurring task management.
- **Analytics Insights:** Offers productivity metrics in visual formats like graphs and pie charts.
- **Export Capability:** Tasks can be exported in CSV and PDF formats.
- **Notifications:** Email, in-app alerts, and optional push notifications for reminders and updates.
- **AI Customization:** Tweaks to AIâ€™s scheduling behavior like day preferences and task spacing.
- **Task Organization & Tagging:** Supports task categorization and visual tagging.
- **AI Learning:** System adjusts based on user task rescheduling patterns.
- **Rate Limiting and Upgrades:** Free plan limits with options to upgrade seamlessly.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 using TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, integrated with Shadcn UI, Radix UI, and animated by Framer Motion. Data managed through TanStack Query.
- **Backend & Storage:** Supabase utilizing PostgreSQL 15 with real-time features and RLS, using Prisma ORM for data handling, and tRPC for API communication.
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI GPT-4 for converting natural language into calendar tasks.
- **Authentication & Security:** Managed by Clerk with complete OAuth handling and session management.
- **Third-Party Integrations:** Built-in support for Google Calendar and Stripe for billing. Redis through Upstash for managing AI usage limits.
- **Development Environment:** Enhanced by Cursor plug-in in IDE for AI-driven code suggestions.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Interfaces and major operations should respond within 2 seconds.
- **Security Standards:** Implementation of SSL/TLS, strong encryption of stored user data.
- **Usability:** Clean UI design supporting both light and dark modes with responsive features.
- **Compliance:** Only necessary OAuth permissions for Google Calendar with GDPR compliance.
- **Reliability:** Regular data backups and server monitoring to preemptively address any issues.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

- Dependence on GPT-4 availability may limit functionality under high demand.
- Stable internet is assumed for optimal real-time syncing and collaboration features.
- Initially, the focus is on individual users; team collaboration may expand later.
- Current design assumes Google Calendar is the primary external calendar service.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

- **API Rate Limits:** Scheduled usage monitoring to prevent exceeding limits of OpenAI and Google API.
- **Data Conflicts:** Strategies needed for real-time data conflicts in calendar syncing.
- **Sensitive Data Security:** Continuous adherence to data security best practices required.
- **User Control vs AI:** Ensuring AI does not override user intentions, maintaining user trust and control.
- **Billing Clarity:** Stripe integration must clearly articulate plan features and handle all potential upgrade/downgrade scenarios efficiently.
